        When double glazed unit have condensation between the two panes of glass
        this is because the double glazed unit has broken down/failed.


        If you look at the your double glazed unit, you will see a silver metal or grey plastic spacer bar in between the two pieces of glass.The spacer bar contains desiccant material, this material is like the small bags that you get in a new pair of trainers or furniture. This material draws out any moisture that is between the double glazed units.


        Double glazed units installed correctly have a life span of up to 2 decades and all units replaced by the door surgeon come with a manufactures guarantee of 10 years

      description: Double glazed units fail due to a combination of atmosphere
        conditions and sunlight.When sunlight shines directly onto the double
        glazed unit it warms the air in the unit, which expands the glass and
        pressure on the seal then unit cools and the pressure decreases. Over
        time this action pulls the air out of the double glass unit so
        condensation can then form.The desiccant in the spacer bar will stop the
        condensation building up but over time the desiccant become saturated
        and no longer functions.

        Firstly the units look dirty, and will never improve, they will only get
        worse over time. Misty units also stop light from getting into your
        rooms.


        Secondly misty double glazed units that have broken down are no longer energy efficient, so will leak heat out of your home costing you money.
