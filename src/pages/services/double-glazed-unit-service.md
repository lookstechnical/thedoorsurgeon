        If your window looks steamed up or misted it may be time to get a new
        double-glazing unit. This can be caused from condensation between the
        two panes of glass where the double-glazed unit has broken down or
        failed. This will only get worse over time, it can also stop the light
        from entering the room and is also no longer energy efficient, so the
        heat will leak out of your home costing you money.


        The Door Surgeon can easily replace your window/double-glazing units, call now for a free quote.
