        Do you have a gap between the window sash and the window frame when
        trying to close your window, which is letting in a cold draught? If so,
        you may need a new hinge or the rubber seals replacing.


        If a window cleaner has trouble reaching your windows due to conservatory’s or other obstacles, The Door Surgeon can change your hinges to easy clean hinges. Which allows access to both sides of the window.

        UPVC.

        If your window looks steamed up or misted it may be time to get a new
        double-glazing unit. This can be caused from condensation between the
        two panes of glass where the double-glazed unit has broken down or
        failed. This will only get worse over time, it can also stop the light
        from entering the room and is also no longer energy efficient, so the
        heat will leak out of your home costing you money.
