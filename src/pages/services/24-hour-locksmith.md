      heading: Lock replacement
      description: >-
        We can replace all multi point locks including WINK HAUS, GU, AVOCET,
        SOBINCO , MILA.


        If you have a lock that is broken, or if you want a lock upgrading, i.e from an old style 4 roller lock to a 4 hook lock, then give us a call for a free no obligation quote.


        If other locksmiths have said the lock is discontinued then give us a call, we specialise in finding locks and materials that others cant.


        If your door handle is stiff to lock or the door sash is catching the frame it probably just needs re-packing or realigning before the lock breaks.


        If your door handle is moving but the door is not opening, you probably need a new lock, and not a new door like some window manufactures will tell you.


        The door surgeon can easily replace most multi point lock at only a fraction of the cost of a new door.
