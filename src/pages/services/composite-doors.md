              replacement service, covering the west yorkshire area. We now
              exclusively install one stop composite doors, which offer the best in
              high security, low maintance and weather resistance. At the Door Surgeon
              we belive it is pointless having the best composite doors unless they
              are fitted correctly. Thats why we take our time to fit the doors, level
              and correctly, and make sure they lock perfect before we leave your
              home. We have 14 years experience in the industry and have built up a
              good reputation.

              To make the door super-strong, the lock edge has been fitted with a full
              length of 4mm thick, powder coated aluminium lock strip. Then your
              preferred lock sits flush inside your door.which adds to the security


              To give great definition and long life performance Door-Stop doors use glass reinforced plastic skins. That’s the same material used to make the hulls of boats! Which means no colour fading and no painting.The GRP skins give a textured finish to look like a traditional timber door but will not rot or worpe.

              The new era lock is the latest in high security multipoint locks.The
              lock uses a traditional mortise key so doesn't need a euro cylinder like
              most upvc doors.no cylinder means your door can not be attact by
              burgalars looking to snap or bump the cylinder.
