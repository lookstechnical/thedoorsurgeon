        At the Door Surgeon we can replace all multi-point locks. If you find
        your handle is spinning and your door will not open it may because your
        mechanism is broken – we can easily get your door open and replace your
        mechanism at an honest and affordable price.


        We also offer mechanism upgrades for example, if you have only a four-roller mechanism, we can upgrade this to a 3 hook 2 mushroom mechanism.


        If you have been told by other locksmiths or installers that your lock is discontinued give us a call.

      description: Are your doors a weak point for burglars? Here at The Door Surgeon
        we have many different security upgrades to suit you. The most common
        way for burglars to enter your house is through snapping the door lock.
        West Yorkshires Police stats show that over 27% of burglaries are from
        lock snapping. This can easily be resolved by replacing your cylinders
        to an anti snap 3-star lock and replacing your handles to the highest
        security handle. We can also install door sash jammers and door chains
        for extra security, please call for a free door security assessment.

        Is you door catching or hard to close? You may have been told you need a
        new door? This is probably not the case; you may just need new hinges at
        a fraction of the cost.


        If you have an old-style pencil hinge these can be very weak with very little adjustment. The Door Surgeon can easily replace and upgrade your pencil hinges to a more modern stronger flag hinge. Another common hinge replacement is on French doors as the can snap in high winds. The Door Surgeon can replace your hinges and install a restrictor to stop this from happening again.
