        We can easily replace all your window hardware. If your window handle is
        moving but your window is not opening, you are probably in need a new
        handle or a new window locking mech.


        When you close your window is there a gap between the sash and the frame? you probably need new hinges or new rubber seals.


        If you are worried about young children falling out of the windows we can fit restrictors to the sash so the window will only open a small amount so children cannot fall out.


        We can also replace and fit -:


        * Handles

        * Hinges/friction stays

        * Bubble gaskets/rubber seals

        * Restrictors

        * Sash jammers.
