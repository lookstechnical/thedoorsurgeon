        a method of snapping the euro cylinder ( the weak point of your door
        security ).


        We provide security upgrades to doors and windows, Burglar proof door handles and door cylinders which the police are advising the public to install. All our handles and cylinders have been tested to the highest standards and are secured by design


        Euro profile cylinders are normally fitted to UPVC and composite doors but in some cases can be fited to aluminum or timber doors. If you are unsure of the euro profile of your door or unsure if you need to upgrade your locks you can email of text a picture of your locks to the door surgeon and we will be more then happy to give you the advice or information you need.

      description: The door surgeon can easily fit high security to your existing
        door. High security handles have a cover plate over the euro cylinder,
        so the euro can't be attacked by a burglar. Replacing the handles is a
        highly visable deterate to burgalar. We stock Mila Pro Secure handle
        which is arguably the best on the market.
